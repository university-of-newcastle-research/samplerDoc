## Description of Forstmann experiment

Forstmann et al looked at neural correlates of decision making under time pressure, with an aim to identify areas of the brain associated with speed-accuracy tradeoff. Imaging (fMRI) and behavioural data was collected; however, we will analyse behavioural data from the decision-making task only. In terms of modelling the data, Forstmann expected to find differences in thresholds (direction?) for each of the three speed-emphasis conditions. We have included the Forstmann et als data in the `PMwG` package as a data frame named `forstmann`. The sampler requires a data frame with a <b>`subject`</b> column. The subject column data type can be a factor or numeric.

Table \@ref(tab:forsthead10) shows the first ten trials from the Forstmann dataset. Participants `(n = 19)` were asked to indicate whether a cloud of dots in a random-dot kinematogram (RDK) moved to the left or the right of the screen. The IV was a within-subject, speed-accuracy manipulation where, before each trial began, pariticipants were instructed to make their choice <i>accurately</i> `(condition = 1)`, with <i>urgency</i>`(condition = 3)`or were presented with a <i>neutral</i> message `(condition = 2)`. Stimuli moved either <i>left</i> `(stim = 1)` or <i>right</i> `(stim = 2)` and responses were <i>left</i> `(resp = 1)` or <i>right</i> `(resp = 2)`. Response times `(rt)` were recorded in seconds. For more information about the design of the experiment please see [the original paper](https://www.pnas.org/content/105/45/17538.short).

```{r forsthead10, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}

```

## Linear Ballistic Accumulator Parameters

There are preliminary steps we need to complete before running the sampler. Let's begin by defining the Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA) [@brown2008simplest] model parameters.

* `b` threshold parameter (the evidence required to trigger a response)
* `v` is drift rate or average speed of evidence accumulation
* `A` is the model's start point 
* `t0` is non-decision time 
* `sv` is the standard deviation of drift rate

## Writing the log-likelihood function

Just as we did with the SDT example, we'll write a slow and a fast log-likelihood function. The runtime difference is caused by calling the `dLBA` function line-by-line for the slow log-likelihood and calling the `dLBA` function once for all the data in the fast log-likelihood function. When writing a new log-likelihood function, we suggest starting with a slow, line-by-line function for easier debugging. 


The LBA log-likelihood function takes three arguments: 

* `x` is a named parameter vector (e.g. `pars`)
* `data` is your dataset (e.g.`forstmann`). Your dataset must include a `"subject"` column
* `sample = FALSE` calculates a density function or `TRUE` generates a posterior, predictive sample that matches the shape of data.


The log-likelihood function shown below includes functions from the `rtdists` package for generating data and estimating density. If you'd like to run through this example, it is best to copy the `tw_lba_ll` function from the code block below rather than copying from the separate code chunks where curly braces have been removed.

NOTE: The trialwise log-likelihood is very slow and inneficient because `rLBA` and `dLBA` will be called on each line of the data. This will result in very slow sampling times and is a consequence of the `rtdists` package, not an issue with the PMwG sampling speed. If you have experience writing log-likelihoods, we recommend writing a faster version than our trialwise function, or use the fast log-likelihood we have written in section \@ref(fstLBALL). If you are new to modelling, we recommend trying the trialwise (slow) log-likelihood function as it is easier to follow, troubleshoot and is less likely to result in errors. 

Let's begin by installing `rtdists` package...

```{r instrtdist}
library(rtdists)
```

and now our complete trialwise (slow) log-likelihood function.

```{r trialwiseLL, attr.source = '.numberLines', include=TRUE }
tw_lba_ll <- function(x, data, sample = FALSE) {
  x <- exp(x)
  if (any(data$rt < x["t0"])) {
    return(-1e10)
  }
  
  if (sample) {
    tmp <- numeric(nrow(data))
    data$rt <- rep(NA, nrow(data))
    data$resp <- rep(NA, nrow(data))
  } else {
    out <- numeric(nrow(data))
  }
  
  for (i in 1:nrow(data)) {
    A = x["A"]
    b = x[paste0("b.", data$condition[i])] + A
    vc = x["vc"]
    ve = x["ve"]
    t0 = x["t0"]
    s = c(1, 1)
    
    if (data$stim[i] == 1) {
      vs = c(vc, ve)
      } else {
      vs = c(ve, vc)
      }
    
    if (sample) {
      tmp <- rLBA(n = 1,
                  A = A,
                  b = b,
                  mean_v = vs,
                  sd_v = s,
                  t0 = t0,
                  dist = "norm",
                  silent = TRUE
                  )
      data$rt[i] <- tmp$rt
      data$resp[i] <- tmp$resp
    } else {
      out[i] <- dLBA(rt = data$rt[i],
                     response = data$resp[i],
                     A = A,
                     b = b,
                     mean_v = vs,
                     sd_v = s,
                     t0 = t0,
                     dist = "norm",
                     silent = TRUE
      )
      }
  }
  
if (sample) {
    return(data)
  } else {
    bad <- (out < 1e-10) | (!is.finite(out))
    out[bad] <- 1e-10
    out <- sum(log(out))
    return(out)
  }
}
```


The first line in the `tw_lba_ll` function (Line 2 below) takes the exponent of the parameter values. We do this as the LBA expects values on the real number line. Line 3 and 4 then checks RTs are faster than the non-decision time parameter `t0`, and return a low value, indicating that the given value of `t0` is not likely. 

```{r twLBAll1, attr.source = '.numberLines startFrom="2"', echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
  x <- exp(x)
  if (any(data$rt < x["t0"])) {
    return(-1e10)
```


Now we create a vector with values sampled from the posterior distribution OR estimating the density. If `sample = TRUE`, we remove all responses `(resp)` and rts.  This means when we return `data`, we are returning the posterior predictive data which matches with the associated `subject` and `condition`.

If `sample = FALSE` (the `else` statement from line 11) we create an `out` vector, with a length equal to the number of rows in the dataset, and store the likelihood value for each subject and condition.

```{r twLBAll2, attr.source = '.numberLines startFrom="7"', echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
  if (sample) {
    tmp <- numeric(nrow(data))
    data$rt <- rep(NA, nrow(data))
    data$resp <- rep(NA, nrow(data))
  } else {
    out <- numeric(nrow(data))
  }
```


Next, we loop over rows in the dataset. In this `for` loop, we find the values `(x)` of each parameter in our model for each row, so that any conditional parameters (for example `b` in our model) are correctly assigned. For example, we want to calculate the density for a model that has three threshold parameters (one for each condition; `1  = accuracy`, `2 = neutral`, or `3 = speed`). In the loop, we paste `b.` to the condition in row `[i]` and add `A` (the start point - we do this to ensure the threshold is greater than the starting point). 

On line 22 we set the order of our drift rate parameters. Recall that `stim = 1` is a stimulus moving to the left. `dLBA` requires the drift accumulators to be matched i.e. when `data$stim[i] == 1`, the drift rate for the correct accumulator `(vc)` is in position one, so we order the drift rates; `vs = c(vc, ve)`. The `else` statement addresses right moving stimuli `data$stim[i] == 2`, the incorrect accumulator `(ve)` is the first accumulator, so the drift rate parameter order is `vs = c(ve, vc)`. This ensures that the correct `(vc)` and error `(ve)` drift rates match with the corresponding accumulators for given stimuli. 

```{r twLBAll3, attr.source = '.numberLines startFrom="15"', echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
  for (i in 1:nrow(data)) {
    A = x["A"]
    b = x[paste0("b.", data$condition[i])] + A
    vc = x["vc"]
    ve = x["ve"]
    t0 = x["t0"]
    s = c(1, 1)
    if (data$stim[i] == 1) {
      vs = c(vc, ve)
    } else {
      vs = c(ve, vc)
    }
```

The following section calls the relevant `rtdists` function depending on whether we are sampling from the posterior `(rLBA)` or estimating the density `(dLBA)`. We then input the parameters from above (using the names set above) into the relevant function. When generating data from the posterior (Line 30-37), `rLBA` is called for each line of the data, storing the generated `rt` and `response` given the posterior parameter estimates in the `tmp` vector (which we then reassign to the empty `data$rt` and `data$resp` columns). We set `n = 1`, since we are calling `rLBA` on 1 row of the data. When estimating the density (Line 42 to 50), dLBA is called for each line of the data, storing the probability of the `rt` and `response` under the proposed parameters `(x)` in the `out` vector. 


```{r lbaLL3, attr.source='.numberLines startFrom="29"', echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
  if (sample) {
      tmp <- rLBA(n = 1,
                  A = A,
                  b = b,
                  mean_v = vs,
                  sd_v = s,
                  t0 = t0,
                  dist = "norm",
                  silent = TRUE
                  )
      data$rt[i] <- tmp$rt
      data$resp[i] <- tmp$resp
    } else {
      out[i] <- dLBA(rt = data$rt[i],
                     response = data$resp[i],
                     A = A,
                     b = b,
                     mean_v = vs,
                     sd_v = s,
                     t0 = t0,
                     dist = "norm",
                     silent = TRUE
      )
      }
```

This final section tells the function what to return; `data` - when sampling posterior predictive (Line 56) - or the sum of the likelihoods - when estimating density (Line x - y). On line 58 we take all implausible likelihood values, assign them to the `bad` object and then (line 59) set them to zero. The final two lines within the `else` statement take the log of all likelihood values, sums them, assigns the model’s log-likelihood value to the `out` variable and returns that value.

```{r lbaLL43, attr.source='.numberLines startFrom="55"', echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
if (sample) {
    return(data)
  } else {
    bad <- (out < 1e-10) | (!is.finite(out))
    out[bad] <- 1e-10
    out <- sum(log(out))
    return(out)
  }
```

### Fast LBA Log-likelihood Function {#fstLBALL}

As the data is large, and the `dLBA` function takes some time to run, the log-likelihood code above is computationally inefficient. There are several ways to improve the log-likelihood's performance; in our example below, we reduce the number of calls to `dLBA` to one call. We do this by passing a list of `dLBA` parameter values for the length of the data. 

<b>Note:</b> When generating posterior predictive data, the `rLBA` function is still executed for each row of data; however, it is only executed several times, so computational efficiency is uncompromised.


```{r fast_lba_ll, include=TRUE}
fast_lba_ll <- function(x, data, sample = FALSE) {
  x <- exp(x)
  if (any(data$rt < x["t0"])) {
    return(-1e10)
  }
  if (sample) {
    data$rt <- rep(NA, nrow(data))
    data$resp <- rep(NA, nrow(data))
  } else {
    out <- numeric(nrow(data))
  }
  if (sample) {
    for (i in 1:nrow(data)) {
      A = x["A"]
      b = x[paste0("b.", data$condition[i])] + A
      vc = x["vc"]
      ve = x["ve"]
      t0 = x["t0"]
      s = c(1, 1)
      if (data$stim[i] == 1) {
        vs = c(vc, ve)
      } else {
        vs = c(ve, vc)
      }
      
      tmp <- rLBA(n = 1,
                  A = A,
                  b = b,
                  mean_v = vs,
                  sd_v = s,
                  t0 = t0,
                  dist = "norm",
                  silent = TRUE
                  )
      data$rt[i] <- tmp$rt
      data$resp[i] <- tmp$resp
    }
  } else {
    all_b <- numeric(nrow(data))
    vlist <- list("v.1" = numeric(nrow(data)), 
                 "v.2" = numeric(nrow(data)))
    stim <- levels(data$stim)
    con <- levels(data$condition)
    
    for (c in con) {
      for (s in stim) {
        use <- data$condition == c & data$stim == s
        if (any(use)) {
          bs = x[paste0("b.", c)] + x["A"]
          all_b[use] = bs
          vc = x["vc"]
          ve = x["ve"]
          if (s == 1) {
            vlist$v.1[use] = vc
            vlist$v.2[use] = ve
          } else {
            vlist$v.1[use] = ve
            vlist$v.2[use] = vc
          }
        }
      }
    }
    
    out <- dLBA(rt = data$rt,
                response = data$resp,
                A = x["A"],
                b =  all_b,
                mean_v = vlist,
                sd_v = c(1, 1),
                t0 = x["t0"],
                distribution = "norm",
                silent = TRUE
    )
    }
  
  if (sample) {
    return(data)
  } else {
    bad <- (out < 1e-10) | (!is.finite(out))
    out[bad] <- 1e-10
    out <- sum(log(out))
    return(out)
  }
}
```

You should improve your log-likelihood's performance as you see fit.  When you're confident that your log-likelihood code functions correctly, we suggest saving it as a separate script so it can be sourced and loaded when running the sampler. If you're learning how to write log-likelihood functions, take a look at our [troubleshooting section](#troubleshoot) for tips. 

## PMwG Framework

Now that we have a log-likelihood function, we can set up the `PMwG` sampler. Running the sampler follows the same procedure outlined in the [SDT chapter](#sdtPMwG); we need to set up a vector of model parameter names, create a `priors` object, source our LBA log-likelihood script and then create our `sampler` object.


Let's begin by creating a vector of model parameter names, which we'll use in our log-likelihood function. You can name this object as you wish; however, in our example, we name it `pars`. ^[The parameters you list in the `pars` vector <b>must</b> match those included in your log-likelihood function i.e. they must have the same names and the same number of parameters. Refer to the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshoot) for more detail.] For the `forstmann` dataset, we use three threshold parameters (one `b` for each condition) because we assume that the condition has an effect on level of caution, we include two drift rate parameters: `v1` for the incorrect accumulator and `v2` for the correct accumulator, a start point parameter `A` and a non-decision time `t0` parameter. 

We've made a decision to set the `sv` to 1 to satisfy the scaling properties of the model. As such, we haven't included the `sv` parameter in the `pars` vector - it is found in the LBA's log-likelihood function (see above).

```{r pars}
pars <- c("b1", "b2", "b3", "A", "v1", "v2", "t0")
```


For the mean of the distribution for random effects (theta_mu), we assume a multivariate normal prior. The user can specify the mean and variance of this prior distribution using the object `priors`, which has elements `theta_mu_mean` and `theta_mu_var`. A typical setting for LBA models is to set `theta_mu_mean` to be a zero vector and to set `theta_mu_var` to be a multiple of the identity matrix, e.g. with 9 on the diagonal (representing a standard deviation of 3 for the subject-level means in the prior). 

We create our `priors` object; a list that contains two components:

* `theta_mu_mean` a vector containing the prior for model parameter means
* `theta_mu_var` the prior covariance matrix for model parameters.


```{r priors}
priors <- list(theta_mu_mean = rep(0, length(pars)),
  theat_mu_var = diag(rep(1, length(pars)))
)
```

Now source and load your log-likelihood script <i>before</i> you create the sampler object.
```{r loadLL, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
source(file = "fast_lba_ll.R")
```

Next we specify the PMwG `sampler` object. 
The `pmwgs` function takes a set of arguments (listed below) and returns a list containing the required components for performing the particle metropolis within Gibbs steps.

* `data =` your data - a data frame (e.g.`forstmann`) with a column for participants called <b>`subject`</b>
* `pars =` the model parameters to be used (e.g.`pars`)
* `prior =` the priors to be used (e.g.`priors`)
* `ll_func =` name of log-likelihood function to be used (e.g.`fast_lba_ll`)

```{r forstSampObj, eval=FALSE}
sampler <- pmwgs(data = data,
                 pars = pars,
                 prior = priors,
                 ll_func = fast_lba_ll
                 )
```


### Model start points {#lbaStartPts}
There is also an option to set model start points. We have specified sensible start points for the `forstmann` dataset under the LBA model. If you choose not to specify start points, the sampler will randomly sample points from the prior distribution. 

The `start_points` object contains two vectors:

* `mu` a vector of start points for the mu of each model parameter 
* `sig2` vector containing the start points of the covariance matrix of covariance between model parameters.

<b>Note:</b> <i>Start points must be on the real line. Our log-likelihood function immediately takes the exponent of the start points and only returns positive values, so we use the log of sensible start points here.</i> 

```{r lbaStartPts, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
start_points <- list(mu = c(log(1.2), log(1.2), log(1.2),
                            log(1.4), log(1.3), log(3.5),
                            log(0.13)),
                     sig2 = diag(rep(.01, length(pars)))
                     )
```


### Running the sampler {#run-sampler}

Setup is now complete and we can run the sampler. First, we use the `init` function to generate initial start points for the random effects and store them in the `sampler` object. Here we specify start points by providing values for the `start_mu` and `start_sig` arguments.

```{r runlbaSampler, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
sampler <- init(sampler, 
                start_mu = start_points$mu,
                start_sig = start_points$sig2
                )
```

<br>
To run the sampler, we use the `run_stage` function. To execute the `run_stage` function, you <b>must</b> provide values for two arguments: 


* `pmwgs =` the `sampler` object including parameters that were created by the `init` function above.
* `stage =` the sampling stage (In order; `"burn"`, `"adapt"` or `"sample"`).

The following arguments listed below are optional:


* `iter =` is the number of iterations for the sampling stage. This is similar to running deMCMC, where it takes many iterations to reach the posterior space. Default = 1000.
* `particles =` is the number of particles generated on each iteration. Default = 1000.
* `display_progress =` display a progress bar during sampling
* `epsilon =` is a value between 0 and 1 which reduces the size of the sampling space. We use lower values of epsilon when there are more parameters to estimate. Default = 1.
* `n_cores =` the number of cores on a machine you wish to use to run the sampler. This allows sampling to be run across cores (parallelising for subjects). Default = 1. <b> Note:</b> Setting `n_cores` greater than 1 is only permitted on Linux and Mac OS X machines.


<br>
The first sampling stage is burn-in `"burn"`. The burn-in stage allows time for the sampler to move from the (arbitrary) start points that were provided by the user to the mode of the posterior distribution. This can be checked by examining the chains for stationarity. We take the `sampler` object created in the `init` function above, set the stage argument to `"burn"` and assign the outcome to an object called `burned`. 
<br><b> What about iter, particles and epsilon?</b>

```{r forstlbaburn, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
burned <- run_stage(sampler, 
                    stage = "burn",
                    iter = 500,
                    particles = 2000,
                    epsilon = .5
                    )
```


Next is the adaptation stage `"adapt"`. The adaptation stage draws samples using a simple, but relatively inefficient proposal distribution (the same proposal distribution as the `"burn"`stage). Enough samples are drawn to allow the algorithm to estimate a much more sophisticated and efficient proposal distribution, using conditional normal distributions. We take the `burned` object created in the previous stage and set iterations `iter =` to a high number (e.g. `10000`), as it should exit before reaching this point. If it doesn't, there is likely an issue with acceptance rates, the likelihood function or limited data to operate on (i.e. few trials in some conditions). Here, we have saved the outcome of the adaptation stage to an object called `adapted`.

```{r adaptation, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
adapted <- run_stage(burned, 
                     stage = "adapt", 
                     iter = 10000, 
                     particles = 2000,
                     epsilon = .5
                     )
```

The final stage is the sampling stage `"sample"`. The sampling stage uses the sophisticated and adaptive conditional normal proposal distributions. This allows for very efficient sampling, using far fewer particles. Samples from this stage are taken from the 'posterior distribution' and stored in the `sampled` object. 

``` {r part 7.12,eval=FALSE}
sampled <- run_stage(adapted, 
                     stage = "sample",
                     iter = 1000, 
                     particles = 200,
                     epsilon = .5
                     )
```


The `sampled` object includes all samples from the `"sample"` stage above and the following elements:

* `data`
* `par_names`: parameter names 
* `n_pars`: number of parameters
* `n_subjects`: number of subjects
* `subjects`: subject IDs
* `prior`: list of the prior used
* `ll_func`: the likelihood function specified
* `samples`;
* `alpha`: three dimensional array of random effects draws (dim = parameters x subjects x samples)
* `theta_mu`: two dimensional array of parameter draws (dim = parameters x samples)
* `theta_sig`: three dimensional array of covariance matrix draws (dim = covariance x samples)
* `stage`: specifies the stage the sample is from (length = samples)
* `subj_ll`: likelihood value for each subject for each iteration (dim = subject x samples)
* `a_half`: the parameter used in calculating the inverse Wishart (dim = parameters x samples)
* `idx`: total number of samples
* `last_theta_sig_inv`: the inverse of the last sample for theta_sig (the variance-covariance matrix).

<!-- ## Checking Convergence  -->

<!-- As parameters are concurrently estimated, we cannot observe 'convergence', at least in the same sense as deMCMC. Rather, it is best to check for stationarity of parameters. We can check for convergence if we are uncertain of reasonable parameter values and to be sure of our estimates.  -->

<!-- To check for convergence, we run multiple 'chains' (runs) of the sampler, and check if these chains converge. To do this, we repeat the above steps, being sure to save the output of each chain under a different name. In this example, we run the sampler 3 times, without specifying start points. You can vary the start points or priors to check convergence as well. You could run this process by running the same script n.chains times. In this example, we run them three separate times and save the output as different names.  -->

<!-- The function below gets the names for each chain to operate on.  -->
<!-- ```{r chainlist,include=TRUE} -->

## Simulating Posterior Data

We can generate posterior predictive data by setting `sample = TRUE` in the log-likelihood function above, which generates response times and responses <i>given</i> the posterior parameter estimates. To do this, we used the `gen_pp_data` function below simulate posterior predictive data from the `sampled` object for the 3b model we created above. Our `gen_pp_data` function takes four arguments:

* `sampled`
* `n` specifies the number of posterior samples
* `ll_func =` the log-likelihood function embeded in the `sampled` object
* `rbind.data = ` bind the rows of each predictive sample to SOMETHING

```{r genPPDataFunc, Include=TRUE}
gen_pp_data <- function (sampled, n, ll_func = sampled$ll_func, rbind.data = TRUE) {
  sampled_stage <- length(sampled$samples$stage[sampled$samples$stage == "sample"])
  iterations <- round(seq(from = (sampled$samples$idx - sampled_stage),
                            to = sampled$samples$idx,
                            length.out = n))
  data <- sampled$data
  S <- sampled$n_subjects
  pp_data <- list()
  
    for (s in 1:S){
       print(paste0("subject", s))
      for (i in 1:length(iterations)) {
        print(i)
        x <- sampled$samples$alpha[, s, iterations[i]]
        names(x) <- pars
        out <- ll_func(x = x, 
                       data = data[data$subject == s, ],
                       sample = TRUE)
        
        if (i == 1){
          pp_data[[s]] = cbind(pp_subj = i, out)
        }
        else {
          pp_data[[s]] = rbind(pp_data[[s]],
                         cbind(pp_subj = i, out))
        }
      }
    }
  
    if (rbind.data){
    tidy_pp_data <- do.call(rbind, pp_data)  
    return(tidy_pp_data)
    }
    else {
      return(pp_data)
    }
}
```

```{r loadForstSampled, include = FALSE}
load("forst3b_sampled.RData")
load("ppdata3b.RData")
```

We generate 20 posterior predictive data samples for each model. 
```{r genppdata, eval=FALSE}
pp_data_3b <- gen_pp_data(sampled, n = 20)
```

The returned data is a matrix with the same dimensions and names as `data` -- with the exception of column `pp_subj`. `pp_subj` is the iteration of posterior sample (in this example `i = 1:20`) for the corresponding subject. We now have two matrices based on samples from either model. The response (`resp`) and response time (`rt`) columns now contain posterior predictive data.

In the next section, we will use this to assess descriptive adequacy.

### Assessing Descriptive Adequacy (goodness of fit)

Now we will plot the posterior predictive data against the real data. This may only be useful for some users, as what you do with your data is domain specific.

```{r plotppdata, include=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

            median = median(rt), 
            Q3 = quantile(rt, prob = 0.75),
            acc =  mean(ifelse(stim == resp, 1, 0))
            )

            acc = mean(ifelse(stim == resp, 1, 0))
            )

##Evaluating different models - single threshold LBA. 

Now let's run through an example where we change our model slightly and assume that participants's level of caution does not change with emphasis instructions i.e. their threshold is identical in the `Accuracy`, `Neutral`, and `Speed` conditions. We will call this our "single threshold model" (STM). The STM's log-likelihood has one `b` parameter, instead of three. This change is seen on lines (x) and (y) below.

For brevity, we specify only the fast version of the loglikelihood function for the single threshold model. 


```{r 1bfastll,attr.source = '.numberLines',include=TRUE}
